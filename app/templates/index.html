        <h5>ANNOUNCEMENT</h5>
        <p>Try <a href="https://vdb.smeea.casa">VDB</a> - new tool for card search I made, it is direct successor VTES-DB.</p>
        <p>It has similar look, but has new engine allowing many new options, one of which is DECK BUILDING.</p>
        <p>I will continue to run VTES-DB for those who need it, but don't expect any new features there (only cards updates).</p>

    <div class="info">
    <h5>VERSION</h5>
    <p>Card text based on <a href="http://www.vekn.net/card-lists">vekn.net official list</a>: 2020-12-31 // V5: Fifth Edition.<br>
        Card images by Syndelson <a href="http://www.vekn.net/forum/v-tes-inventory-deckbuilding-programs/78088-feld-update-2-71-with-first-blood">FELD images</a>: 2020-12-31</p>

    <h5>WHAT IS IT</h5>
    <p>Card search utility for Vampire the Eternal Struggle (VTES) collectible card game.<br/>
        It is designed for mobile and desktop resolutions.<br/>

    </p>
    <p>Find more about the game:

        <br/>
        <a href="http://www.blackchantry.com/">Black Chantry Productions</a> - game publisher
    </p>
    <br>

    <h5>WHY</h5>
    <p>Because being active VTES player I want to have the tool at my disposal with clean interface and corresponding to my flow in card search.</p>
    <p>There are several great tools around, but I was not completely happy with any of it - this one is not an exception (that is why it is still evolving).</p>
    <br>

    <h5>NON-OBVIOUS FEATURES</h5>
    <ul style="padding-left: 1em; list-style-type: square">
        <li> Hover cursor over card name to preview card image. </li>
        <li> Click on card name to open card image in separate window. </li>
        <li> Click on other card space to unfold/fold card text. </li>
        <li> Title and Group forms are logic OR, i.e. if you choose <i>Prince, Justicar, G1-G3</i> it will search all Princes and Justicars of Groups 1-3. </li>
        <li> Other search fields are logic AND, i.e. if you choose <i>aus PRE, Ventrue, Capacity <= 6</i> you will only find Beth Malcolm (6-cap aus FOR PRE Ventrue).</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h5>TODO</h5>
    <ul style="padding-left: 1em; list-style-type: square">
        <li> Sorting options: by Name, Group, descending Capacity, etc.</li>
        <li> Search parameters preservation. I know it's painful, it <i>will</i> be fixed.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
